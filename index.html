                TheDooo first started playing guitar when he was around 13 years old. His first instrument was the violin, but he ultimately got tired of the instrument and started playing the guitar his dad had lying around the house. His dad had taught him the basics, but he is mostly self-taught. He started singing when he first started to write music, so he wanted to put vocals to it and decided to give it try.
